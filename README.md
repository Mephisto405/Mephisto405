# In-Young Cho / Ï°∞Ïù∏ÏòÅ

Machine Learning Engineer since 2021.  
**Focus**: 3D Deep Learning, Generative Models, and Real-time Inference.

Currently building 3D content generation systems using large diffusion and language models.  
**Main interest**: making ML models run faster, cheaper, and more useful in production (especially for graphics / game pipelines).
